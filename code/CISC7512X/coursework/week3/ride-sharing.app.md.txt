[weRide] - a ride sharing app company. 

### Company Overview

We are a tech company that connects the physical and digital worlds to make movement happen at the tap of a button for everyone, everywhere. Because we believe in a world where movement should be equally accessible for all. So you can move safely. In a way that‚Äôs sustainable for our planet. And regardless of your gender, race, religion, or sexual orientation, we champion your right to move freely and without fear. Of course, we haven‚Äôt always gotten it right. But we‚Äôre not afraid of failure, because it makes us better, wiser, and stronger. And it makes us even more committed to do the right thing by our customers, people who earn on our platform, local communities and cities, and our incredibly diverse set of international partners.

The idea for weRide was born on a snowy night in Brooklyn in 2022, and ever since then our DNA of reimagination and reinvention carries on. We‚Äôve grown into a global platform moving people and things in ever expanding ways. We‚Äôve gone from rides on 4 wheels to rides on 2 wheels to 18-wheel freight deliveries. From takeout meals to daily essentials to prescription drugs to just about anything you need at any time. From drivers with background checks to real-time verification, safety is a top priority every single day. At weRide, the pursuit of reimagination is never finished, never stops, and is always just beginning.


### Who will Drive for us?

We‚Äôre building a culture within weRide that emphasizes doing the right thing, period, for riders, drivers, and employees. Find out more about the team that‚Äôs leading the way.

## Diversity Matters

It‚Äôs our goal to create a workplace that is inclusive and reflects the diversity of the cities we serve‚Äîwhere everyone can be their authentic self, and where that authenticity is celebrated as a strength. By creating an environment where people from every background can thrive, we‚Äôll make weRide a better company‚Äîfor our employees and our customers.



### Competitive Analysis


The fundamental objective is to promote the efficiency of the service by filling as many available seats in a car as possible, while ensuring an enjoyable and delightful experience for both riders and drivers. With more riders in a vehicle, the costs of riding are shared across more individuals. A lowered cost of transportation provides greater access for a broader set of riders and can unlock new use cases. The Application  is also strategically important for company's growth as it allows the company to service more rides with more paying passengers in the car for drivers. In essence, the Application can create a holistically beneficial scenario wherein riders benefit from lower fare costs; drivers‚Äô time and vehicles are optimally utilized.

This project aims to increase conversion by introducing a **Design,Implement and test a ride sharing app** as a 10-week experiment.

# üèûÔ∏è Context


## Goal

This carpooling service is available at a lower price because riders are able to split the cost of the trip across multiple riders. A rider can pay as much as 50% less than a single taxi service, depending on the city, making it most often a cheapest service.

 In terms of the costs of providing the trip, it includes payout to the driver and the company. For illustrative purposes, a trip going from point A to point B might cost $12 in total. A rider‚Äôs cost for that trip will depend on both the number of riders splitting the cost, and the amount of trip overlap among them.

## Problem we are trying to solve and Solution.

The overall benefit is lower cost for riders and a higher volume of paying passengers for drivers.
As such, the service satisfies customer needs, strategically grows company's business, and benefits cities by improving the usage of each car on the road.
That said, prior user research identified some critical rider experience pain points on this, particularly around routing and affordability. Poor matches cause significant routing detours and prices are not affordable enough. Combined with the goal of delivering a more efficient and enjoyable service.

Findings from this study informed the core characteristics of the drivers reviews. As a result, the Product, Engineering and Research teams formulated a set of refined hypotheses:
‚óè Riders are willing to wait for a short period and walk to an optimal pickup location in exchange for a cheaper price and a faster, more direct route to their destination;
‚óè Riders are willing to trade a predictable pre-trip experience for a lower price and a higher quality on-trip experience with fewer detours.

1. **Free-to-paid conversion rate is too low (~5%).** Comparable services achieve 8-10% ([source](https://help.lrnecgysiam.com/ddaabe07-use-external-links)).
2. **Prior support tickets and survey results show** that unanswered questions and lack of clarity on certain pricing aspects may be partially responsible.
3. **Adding a link to the FAQ section** made no significant difference to the conversion rate.

## Out of scope

1. Major UX Changes
2. Non-English chat support.

## User Experience

1. **Button**: Label it ‚ÄúChat with us‚Äù and put it in the bottom-right corner of the app.
2. **Behavior**: On click, show the support agent‚Äôs name and profile picture, and display the first message ‚ÄúHow can we help you today?‚Äù.
3. **No auto-popup**: We may try this later.

### Application Interface Design
The Front end and middle ware will initially be created using Google's Andriod SDK platform 
and firebase services( authentication, real-time database and storage). 
Google APIs for Maps, OAUTH and Payment Processing (Google Pay API)
We will also apply alternative payment processing like sqaure, stripe and more.

### Database Design

# Tables
- Customers
- Drivers
- DriversAvailable
- AppLogging Actiivity

# Events to Capture
- CustomerAppActivity
- CustomerSettingsActivity
- DriverAppActivity
- DriverSettingsActivity
- LoginAuthenticationStatus
- PaymentActivity
- PayoutActivity
- Logging




Of course being able to integrate everything from scratch will be a big hassle so it would be best to utilize a cookbook or sample app to learn how to leverage the APIS and the real-time database web services.

 customer may have several accounts, and each account may participate in many transactions. Each transaction will have at least two records, one deducting amount from an account, and one adding amount to an account (for a single transactionid, the sum of amounts will equal zero).
Using SQL, answer these questions (write a SQL query that answers these questions):

    What is the balance of accountid=42?
    What was the transaction amount of transactionid=42?
    Which transactionids do not sum up to zero (are invalid)?
    List of customers without accounts?
    What is the balance (total across all accounts) for customerid=42?
    What is the total balance of all customers living in zip code 10001?
    Which zip code has the highest balance?
    List the top 1% of customers (ordered by total balance).
    Using balances for previous two months, predict what the balances will be next month. (tip: find slope of a line; x-axis is days, y-axis is balance. 2 previous months means you have 2 points, finding slope is easy. Use slope to predict where next month's balance will be.)
    List top 10 fastest growing accounts (using previous 2 months). (tip: same as above, fastest growing means steepest slope).
    Write a query to add 0.01% to each savings account (note that the money has to be accounted for).
    For each account, what was the closing balance on December 31, 2016?
    What percentage of bank's money is held by people in the tri-state area today? (NY, NJ, CT)

***Review***

I just completed this simple site with a open source project 
called 11ty.dev. (Eleventy) It uses NodejS and Nunjucks Templating engine to rapidly put together websites, for blogging, documentation, and more. 

For deployent of the website I am currently using Netlify. Netlify is your go to source for obtaining custom domains, managing your application from a version control system like Github, gitlab or bitbucket.

 Being Remote whether is for school, work, or pleasure you should be able to manage your work and share your information with out too much trouble with a static site generator. I have been a web developer for about 10 years and I can not stress the idea of being able to use your own web tools and sites to share and control information. Using Social Media is great as a tool for getting notice and connecting with like minded individuals but it shuoldnt be where all your information about you lives.

 If you would like a quick tutorial for getting a website up and running please feel free to contact me at  my either email addresses.

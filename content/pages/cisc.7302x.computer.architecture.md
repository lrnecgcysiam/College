***Review***

I just completed this simple site with a open source project 
called 11ty.dev. (Eleventy) It uses NodejS and Nunjucks Templating engine to rapidly put together websites, for blogging, documentation, and more. 

For deployent of the website I am currently using Netlify. Netlify is your go to source for obtaining custom domains, managing your application from a version control system like Github, gitlab or bitbucket.

 Being Remote whether is for school, work, or pleasure you should be able to manage your work and share your information with out too much trouble with a static site generator. I have been a web developer for about 10 years and I can not stress the idea of being able to use your own web tools and sites to share and control information. Using Social Media is great as a tool for getting notice and connecting with like minded individuals but it shuoldnt be where all your information about you lives.

 If you would like a quick tutorial for getting a website up and running please feel free to contact me at  my either email addresses.
